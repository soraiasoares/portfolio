                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <p>CGMP Promotora is a credit promoter that seeks to improve their sales. According to their internal analyses, the percentage of closing new customers was not satisfactory and this was due to the lack of knowledge and experience of the employees.
                    With all of this in mind, they realized they were facing two problems:
                    <br>1. They need to increase their employees knowledge and experience;
                    <br>2. They need to keep their employees motivated to improve and close more sales.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="solution">
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>There were a couple potential solutions for this challenge, like buying online courses for their employees or plan on site courses/events for interactive learning. But these options were not ideal, as the team is growing and the sales department cannot stop for long periods of time (so they would have to buy courses or prepare events every month for a couple of days, what is very expensive and not so productive).
                    Therefore the best solution was to have their Lead Salesperson record quick and effective videos with the sales know-how to prepare the sales team to meet their goals. In their new mobile app, their employees will find a video format lesson guide with quizzes to be approved, as well as a very useful goals panel to keep track of your personal and business goals.

                 <h3>WHY THE SALES TEAM DIDN'T MEET THEIR GOALS?</h3>
                 <p>
                        First we needed to understand what was the true problem affecting the sales goals so we could tackle it first.
                        Talking with the managers we realized that the lack of knowledge (know-how) was a common thing in the sales team, as they were young people just starting their new job.
                        So what could we do to improve their sales knowing in a simple and didactic way, without waisting too much time and money?
                        As the Lead Salesperson has a strong background in sales and creates content regularly, the idea for in-house video classes came up.
                        To facilitate the content distribution and assessment of the sales team knowledge, the mobile app was the best idea to go with.
                        Besides that it was also noted that the employees had a hard time to keep up with their sales goals, because only the managers had access to them. With the new mobile app, they will get access to all their goals (past, current and future ones).

                     <h3>USERS NEED TO FIND EVERYTHING QUICKLY. HOW WILL THE MOBILE APP WORK?</h3>
                     <p>
                        Together with the mobile app developer, we worked on how the mobile app should function. First we started with a loose sketch to understand what steps the user will need to make. We also structured the information, so the most important and actionable items were easier to find and access.
                        Second I created a flow chart representing all the screens the mobile app should have and how the use would navigate the mobile app, passing through different pages.

                     <p>
                        This project was very interesting as I was able to talk and work closely with the brand stakeholders and also with the app developer responsible to bring the design vision into reality.
                        The UX & UI design were only the first steps. Right now the mobile app is been developed and soon it will be available.
                        As for next steps, I would run some user testings to improve further the navigation of the mobile app. Also would like to interview a few people from the sales team in 2/3 months after the app is launched, to understand how the mobile app is helping them progress on their goals.
                        Hope in a few months I can have some metrics to evaluate how the mobile app is being helpful and where we could improve it even further.
                        Will happily update this case study when I have more information to share with you all.
